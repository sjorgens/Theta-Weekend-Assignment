# Theta-Weekend-Assignment

Hey everybody -

This weekend we will be using what we've learned Services to call the GitHub API via our Service, bind it into our Controller and display it in the DOM using something like ng-repeat. After you've got it all being put into the DOM, style it with the Bootstrap (http://www.getbootstrap.com) skills we learned in class.

Example $http call can be found in Theta slack chat.
